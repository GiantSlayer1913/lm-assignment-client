<p> To set up you must do the following:
<ul>
<li>Npm install</li>
<li>Install babel, react, react-router, react-dom & webpack</li>
<li>To run locally, ``npm run dev``</li>
</ul>

### Personal thoughts:
<p>Overall, I'm proud of the progress I made with this assignment given the short amount of time (few days). Since, I am really new to React, I expected to get just a 404 Not found. However, in sandbox and in my development I was able to log the entire list of objects from Hubways stations in the console. This proves that my method of retrieving the JSON data from the API location to be on the the right track.
<br />
<br />
My biggest struggle in this project was determining the right React methods to retrieve the data. I did a lot of searches online to see if someone else had created a template for this specific action. I eventually found a series of tutorial videos explaining the process and studyied them carefully. From there, I had to determine the right way to interpolate the data. I came close when I figured out how to log it in the console, but so far, I have not gone the full distance and mapped the data correctly. In this project, I did not seek out any help from peers or developers that I know personally.
<br />
<br />
I hope in future React projects that I will try to minimize the setup/installation time. Then, I will have more energy and confidence to solve the problems & challenges faced in later steps.
<br />
<br />
Best,
